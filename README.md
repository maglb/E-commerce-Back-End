# E-commerce-Back-End

Module 13 Challenge

## Description

For this project, our task was to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application will use an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

During this project we learned, how to connect the back-end to the front-en application. We used skills about creating routes with GET, POST and DELETE requests.

Below are the assigmemnt's requirements:

### User Story

* AS A manager at an internet retail company
* I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
* SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies

### Acceptance Criteria

* GIVEN a functional Express.js API
* WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
* THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
* WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
* THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
* WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
* THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
* WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags
* THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
* WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia Core
* THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database

## How to use it

Click on the 'Get Started' Button to acces to the Note Taker interface. Enter in the test fields the title of your task/note and write more information in the second text field. Once these fields completed, click on the 'Save Note' button to save your note. Once saved, it will appear in the left section of the screen. You can delete completed taks or old notes by click on the 'delete' button in red.
